Modified by grj1234, modified portions are:
* The log message
* Save only one book specified as argument, instead of trying to scrape all the books
* Single-thread main routine instead of multi-thread one (image processing routine is still multi-thread)
* Save image files as PNG instead of JPG (to avoid degradation of image quality)
